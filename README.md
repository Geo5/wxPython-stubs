# wxPython typing stubs package

âš  Does not contain any tests whatsoever

Autogenerated from [my wxPython fork](https://github.com/Geo5/Phoenix/tree/types-event) which contains some improvements to the `.pyi` code generation not yet upstreamed.
The fork is based on somewhere around version 4.2.3, but the type stubs are probably useful for older version as well. I am using them for working with wxPython 4.2.1 personally.

Regenerate all `*.pyi` files (in Phoenix git):

```bash
python build.py touch etg
```

Copy all `*.pyi` files from Phoenix git to here:

```bash
cd wx && find . -name '*.pyi' | cpio -pdmu <path-to-this-project>/src/wx-stubs/
```
