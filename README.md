# wxPython typing stubs package

âš  Does not contain any tests whatsoever

Autogenerated from [my wxPython fork](https://github.com/Geo5/Phoenix/tree/types-event) which contains some improvements to the `.pyi` code generation not yet upstreamed.
The fork is based on somewhere around version 4.2.3, but the type stubs are probably useful for older version as well. I am using them for working with wxPython 4.2.1 personally.

Regenerate all `*.pyi` files (in Phoenix git):

```bash
python build.py touch etg
```

Copy all `*.pyi` files from Phoenix git to here:

```bash
cd wx && find . -name '*.pyi' | cpio -pdmu <path-to-this-project>/src/wx-stubs/
```

## Todos/Differences to upstream

- [ ] 2 Phase etg execution: [PR #2776](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/2776)
- [ ] Should `c`s `char` and `char*` be Python `bytes`? Currently the conversion is defined as `str`. (See [review in PR #2468](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/2468))
- [ ] Remove `wx.` from `TypeAlias`es `_TwoInt` and similar in files other than `core.pyi`
- [ ] Remove duplicate `wx.Colour` in some/all/? `Union`s
- [ ] Does `SpinCtrlDouble` accept Python `Decimal`s in `SetValue(...)` and similar? If yes does this conversion apply to `c` `float64` in general and should be recorded as automatic conversion?
- [ ] Sip generates some `c` array wrapper classes (created in etg scripts), which are recorded in type hints, but don't exists as classes in `.pyi` files
- [ ] Function (and `@property`) names shadow classes in type hints. E.g. the following is a bad type hint on `f()`:
```python
class Foo: ...
class Bar:
    def f(self) -> Foo: ...
    @property
    def Foo(self) -> None: ...
```
